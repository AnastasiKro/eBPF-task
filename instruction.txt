sectracer.py is bcc Python script for Linux.
It detects user actions that involve designated secret values (strings of the following format: SECRET=<secret_value>\x00 (ASCII encoding)).
Every time a secret is read from/written to a file, the program prints 'Found secret "secret".'
As far as eBPF techology is used, to run the program successfully, you must have superuser rights.

Run the program:
# python3 sectracer.py
or
# ./sectracer.py

If you have permission error, use 
# chmod +x sectracer.py 
to get execute rights to the program.

To stop the program use Ctrl+Z.

If you want to filter events by given user id, pass the id as an argument:
# ./sectracer.py <id>
